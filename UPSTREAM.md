# Upstream Tiny Tapeout templates

This template supports every Tiny Tapeout PDK from one repo: `project.pdk` in `info.yaml` selects it. Tiny Tapeout
keeps one template per PDK. This repo is a Git fork of the SKY130 one (remote `upstream`), and folds in the
PDK-specific parts of the other two, which it does not track by Git. Last synced from:

## What the pin fixes

The `tt-gds-action` commit determines the LibreLane version (3.0.14; 3.1.0.dev4 for `ihp-sg13cmos5l`), and with
it the PDK version, along with precheck's PDK commits and the gate-level test's Icarus build. `tt-support-tools`
(TT's hardening scripts and checks) is not pinned: the action's `tools-ref` defaults to `main`, as in TT's own
templates. Each build records what it actually used in its `tt_submission` artifact (`pdk.json`:
LibreLane version, PDK and PDK version; `commit_id.json`).

## The PDK-specific parts

- `.github/workflows/{gds,docs,fpga}.yaml`: one `tt-gds-action` commit for every PDK, instead of TT's per-shuttle
  tags, and `pdk:` read from `info.yaml`. The action picks the LibreLane version from `pdk`, and its precheck,
  gate-level test, and viewer read the PDK from the build.
- `test/Makefile`: the gate-level cell models for each PDK.
- `test/tb.v`: power pins under `USE_POWER_PINS`, which `test/Makefile` sets for the PDKs whose netlists have them.
- `src/config.json`: IHP's power-grid settings, in a `pdk::ihp-sg13*` block.
- `info.yaml`: `pdk`, and the tile-size comment.
- `.devcontainer`: SKY130 only, as in TT's SKY template.

## Updating

1. **SKY130:** `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main`. Keep the files above PDK-generic when resolving
   conflicts; a per-shuttle tag bump (`@ttskyNNx`) conflicts with the pinned commit, so keep the commit (step 3).
2. **GF180 and IHP:** list what changed since the commit above, e.g.
   `gh api repos/TinyTapeout/ttgf-verilog-template/compare/e0d770f...main --jq '.files[].filename'`, and port any
   change to the files above (shuttle tag bumps excepted).
3. **tt-gds-action:** pin the newest commit that contains every current shuttle tag (usually `main`): for each
   tag, `gh api repos/TinyTapeout/tt-gds-action/compare/<tag>...<commit> --jq .status` gives `ahead` or
   `identical`. Use the full SHA in all three workflows.
4. Update the table, then test on the demo project for each PDK, as the `tt-makerchip-template-dev` skill
   describes. (This repo's own `gds` and `docs` runs fail by design: its project info is blank.)
